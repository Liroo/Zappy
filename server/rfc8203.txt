                             Zappy Spectator Protocol

 Status of this memo:

    This RFC specified the connection as a spectator to the Zappy server. This is
    under edition of Pierre Monge and will be improved by Lucas Onillon and Zappy
    group project team.

 1. INTRODUCTION

    The spectator protocol for Zappy provide a way to connect as zappy server then
    to know how to interpret info it send to the spectator. The spectator is used
    basicly to interpret the actual infos of the server players, it can be
    graphical or not.

 2. OVERVIEW

   This is a connection based application on TCP. A server listens for TCP
   connections on TCP port 1024 (decimal). Once a connection is established, the
   server reads a line of data which specifies the connection of interest. As this
   RFC specified the protocol of spectator only, we are not gonna explain the other
   clients.
   The server may then either shut the connection down or it may continue to
   read/respond to multiple queries.

 3. CONNECTION REQUEST

   Connection request is the first request to send to the server. Once the server
   is up and the spectator want to connect to receive informations, the spectator
   should send "spectator\n" to the socket of the server through TCP. If the server
   respond well, it will ask you for a password. Spectator should be treated as non
   exhausting that the password is also "spectator\n".

 Note:

   1) There is no commands handled by the server from the Spectator clients. This
      is why there is not complicated password. Anyway, the spectator will know all
      of the informations of the actual party. This is why we do not considere a
      spectator as a client.

 4. RESPONSE FORMAT

    The server will send to spectators simple text response of the form:

    	<id> [<fd player> || <team name>] [<info>]

    where:
	- id is the actual id of such information, this could be a command id
    executed by a client or just an information.
    	- fd || team is the fd player's OR the team of such the team
    concerned by the info.
    	- info is extended infos of concerned id.

 Note on response format:

   1) The response format is padded of 511 char and os following by a "\n".
      Which give a 512 char response size each time an info is given to the
      spectator.
